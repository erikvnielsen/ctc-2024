1) Arbitrage on the prices of the ETF/short etf. Trade forward and backward based on its prices
Need to be quickly in trading it, fast computations

2) Idea 1 is to make a bot to beat the best bid and ask slightly so we profit off of naive bots
Do this by storing our best bid and best ask, and if it differs from current best orders, cancel them and place new ones





TODO:
Email Mike about the intricacies of the short ETF, and how to redeem it
Ask about `on_trade_completion`, and why its not called
Can we sell shares of stocks that we don't own

1) Arbitrage on the prices of the ETF/short etf. Trade forward and backward based on its prices
Need to be quickly in trading it, fast computations

2) Idea 1 is to make a bot to beat the best bid and ask slightly so we profit off of naive bots
Do this by storing our best bid and best ask, and if it differs from current best orders, cancel them and place new ones
dont use "get_current_orders", it's too slow

3) Some formula calculation to offload held shares so that we remain market neutral
i.e if we're holding too make google shares, make our best ask slightly lower so that we're able to sell more of them




TODO:
Email Mike about the intricacies of the short ETF, and how to redeem it
Ask about `on_trade_completion`, and why its not called
Can we sell shares of stocks that we don't own



Optimizations from Erik's Code
1) Don't need to check about canceling, just place the best order we can and then immediately cancel our previous order
2a) ETF arbitrage can't be done with the theo, need to compare the direct bid/asks
2b) Also make sure to buy and sell the ETF + underlying at that moment, that's how we obtain the edge. Don't want to be holding either
3) Maybe don't arbitrage SMAG? Don't know what's the underlying conversion of that

4) Pairs trading with MAG and SMAG
